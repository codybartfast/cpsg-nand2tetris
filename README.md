# CPSG-Nand2Tetris
Exercises from the Nand2Tetris season at Cambridge Programmer's Study Group 

Between July 2014 and February 2015 the [Cambridge Programmer's Study Group](http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Programmers-Study-Group/) completed the [Nand2Tetris course](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).  This is my mess from the project exercises.  At some point I got every test to pass, but the good (or least bad) version is not always the one that survived.

It's a top notch course, which I thoroughly recommend.

A Big Thanks to [Brice Fernandes](http://fractallambda.com/) for organising the group and the course.
